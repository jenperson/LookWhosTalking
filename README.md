# Look Who's Talking

This repository contians an iOS app project that runs in Xcode. It is written in Swift and requires [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). The appropriate pods can be downloaded by running `pod install` from the command line.

## Use cases

Some individuals or groups tend to dominate the conversation. Members of groups that are underrepresented in their respective fields often find that they are drowned out in meetings. My purpose in making *Look Who's Talking* is to shed light on this issue by providing evidence.

## How it works

Currently, this project is still at a very early stage. Users can record 20 seconds of speaking. They can name 2-5 speakers, and then select who is speaking. The outcome is a percent breakdown of how much each individual was speaking.

## Next steps

There is much to be done. Here are some of my short-term and long-term goals for the app:
- Improve the UI to make it intuitive and attractive
- Store audio in Cloud Storage
- Allow users to select who is speaking while recording or while playing (currently can only select during recording)
- Add authentication and save conversations to be accessed again by the user
- Incorporate machine learning to automatically detect who is speaking and mark this automatically
